# Dotfiles
Just my personal dotfiles, to make transfer easy

## Modules

* bash
* [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
* [libinput-gestures](https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures): allows trackpad gestures to produce keyboard/mouse events. Some of the functionality requires [my fork of `xdotool`](https://github.com/avernan/xdotool)
